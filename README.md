# FLEX

A FLEX Management System is a Database that is used to manage and schedule university studentsâ€™ academic information. There are 3 main types of users in FLEX Student,
Admin, and Faculty. This database system allows students faculty and admin to manage and interact with one another. This database system consists of tables that represent different aspects
of the university management system. The tables have been designed to store information related to students, faculty, courses, grades, attendance, quizzes, assignments, sessionals, projects,
feedback, and sections.

Moreover more details about the project including its ERD and Relational Schema is available in the project report
This database gives an insight to manages multiple types of users and their data to strealime their daily routine tasks; so code from this project can also be used to facilate other
types of database systems that use C#, SQL and ASP.net
